# Swarm

For the relevant task, read [delegation](../pstack-poteto-mode/references/delegation.md), [local-runs](../pstack-poteto-mode/references/local-runs.md). These procedures define the OpenCode execution steps.


Fan out N parallel read-only workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is the total read-only worker count.
4. Omit `model` unless the user explicitly selected a model or comparison. Discover exact provider/model IDs through OpenCode and use only approved choices. Report actual models, not assumed diversity.
5. Each worker returns a report rather than editing. Verification briefs name exact revisions and methods. Poteto owns any required commands or writes that the delegate cannot perform.

## Phase B: Fan out

Use `subagent` with a permitted read-only `agent` and `background: true` for
independent work. There is no cloud environment or cloud-base-branch option.
If a check requires machine isolation, report that prerequisite as blocked.
Wait for completion notifications rather than polling.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
